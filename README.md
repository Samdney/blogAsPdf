# blogAsPdf

In this repository you can find my blog posts from
[https://Samdney.github.io](https://Samdney.github.io) as pdf files.

Currently, this pdf's are still generated very messy with

```
pandoc inputfile.md --pdf-engine=xelatex -o outputfile.pdf
```

I promise, I will work on this and make it better :).
