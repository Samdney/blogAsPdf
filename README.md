# blogAsPdf

*Attention:* This repository isn't up-to-date. If you also want to read the newer posts, please visit the mentioned blog itself.  

In this repository you can find my blog posts from
[https://blog.carolin-zoebelein.de](https://blog.carolin-zoebelein.de) as pdf files.

Currently, this pdf's are still generated very messy with

```
pandoc inputfile.md --pdf-engine=xelatex -o outputfile.pdf
```

I promise, I will work on this and make it better :).
